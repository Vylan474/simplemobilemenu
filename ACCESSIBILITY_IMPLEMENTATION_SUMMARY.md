## 🛠️ Major Implementations

### 1. Color Contrast Fixes
**Problem**: Multiple elements had insufficient contrast ratios (2.87:1 to 3.48:1)
**Solution**: Updated colors to meet WCAG AA 4.5:1 minimum requirement

```css
/* Before: Insufficient contrast */
color: #7f8c8d; /* 3.48:1 ratio */

/* After: WCAG AA compliant */
color: #6c797a; /* 4.5:1 ratio */
```

### 2. Navigation Accessibility
**Problem**: 25+ broken anchor links pointing to non-existent sections
**Solution**: Replaced with accessible alternatives and proper ARIA labels

```html
<!-- Before: Broken link -->
<a href="#terms">Terms of Service</a>

<!-- After: Accessible placeholder -->
<a href="javascript:void(0)" role="button" 
   aria-label="Terms of Service - Coming soon">Terms of Service</a>
```

### 3. ARIA Labels and Semantic HTML
**Problem**: Missing accessibility labels on 50+ interactive elements
**Solution**: Added comprehensive ARIA labels and semantic structure

```html
<!-- Before: No accessibility context -->
<button id="save-menu" class="btn btn-primary">
    <i class="fas fa-save"></i> Save Menu
</button>

<!-- After: Full accessibility support -->
<button id="save-menu" class="btn btn-primary" 
        aria-label="Save current menu changes">
    <i class="fas fa-save" aria-hidden="true"></i> Save Menu
</button>
```

### 4. Keyboard Navigation Enhancement
**Problem**: Incomplete keyboard accessibility and no skip links
**Solution**: Comprehensive keyboard navigation with shortcuts

```html
<!-- Skip links for efficiency -->
<a href="#menu-container" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
<a href="#toolbar" class="skip-link">Skip to toolbar</a>
<a href="#sidebar" class="skip-link">Skip to menu management</a>
```

### 5. Focus Management
**Problem**: Poor focus visibility and no modal focus trapping
**Solution**: Enhanced focus indicators and proper focus management

```css
/* High-contrast focus indicators */
button:focus, input:focus, select:focus {
    outline: 3px solid #FF4C29 !important;
    outline-offset: 2px !important;
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px #ffffff, 0 0 0 4px #FF4C29 !important;
}
```

### 6. Mobile Accessibility
**Problem**: Touch targets smaller than WCAG minimum (44x44px)
**Solution**: Responsive touch target optimization

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    button, input, select, .btn {
        min-height: 44px !important;
        min-width: 44px !important;
        padding: 8px 12px !important;
    }
}
```
